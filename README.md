Zepto SQL Project – Business Insights
Project Overview

This project explores a real-world e-commerce dataset (3000+ rows) to practice SQL fundamentals and uncover actionable business insights.
I created a database, imported data from a CSV file, and wrote multiple SQL queries to analyze inventory, pricing, and revenue trends.

--Steps I Took--
Created Database & Table – Designed schema with appropriate data types (including BOOLEAN for outOfStock).
Imported CSV Data – Faced and resolved import errors (column mismatches, TRUE/FALSE issues, permissions).
Data Cleaning – Checked for nulls, duplicates, and zero prices.
Analysis & Insights – Solved multiple business questions using GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINs (where required), and aggregate functions.

--Insights & Learnings--

Biggest revenue contributors were limited to just a few categories → potential to double down on best-selling product lines.
A surprising number of products were out of stock, including some with high MRP → restocking strategy needed.
Some products had price = 0 → likely data entry errors affecting revenue calculation.
Found categories with heavy discounting but low revenue → discount strategy might not be driving enough sales.


--Skills Practiced--

Database creation & schema design
LOAD DATA INFILE for CSV imports
Data cleaning using SQL
Business-oriented query writing
Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, ROUND)
Sorting, filtering, and ranking results

This project was my first hands-on SQL experience, and it gave me confidence in working with real data and deriving business insights, a great step forward in my Data Analytics journey!
